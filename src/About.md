# MemoryWhole

## Overview
MemoryWhole is a memory training application designed to help users improve their memorization skills through practice and repetition. The app presents users with passages of text that they can select, study, and then attempt to reproduce from memory.

## Features

### Interactive Learning Flow
1. **Tutorial Guide**: New users are greeted with a tutorial that explains how to use the application.
2. **Reference Selection**: Users can choose from a variety of thought-provoking passages on topics like Ancient Wisdom, Cosmic Perspective, Technological Revolution, Neural Plasticity, Information Theory, and Memory Palaces.
3. **Reference Confirmation**: Before beginning the memorization exercise, users can review their selected passage.
4. **Memory Challenge**: Users type the passage from memory, with real-time feedback on their progress.
5. **Completion Tracking**: Upon successful completion, users receive feedback on their performance, including the time taken to complete the challenge.

### Responsive Design
- The application is built with a responsive design that works across different device sizes.
- Clean, minimalist interface that helps users focus on the memory task at hand.
- Smooth transitions between different stages of the application using animation.

## The Science Behind MemoryWhole

The application is built on established memory techniques and cognitive science principles:

- **Active Recall**: By challenging users to reproduce text from memory, the app leverages the proven technique of active recall, which strengthens memory pathways more effectively than passive review.
- **Instant Feedback**: Through color coding the text that they input they can know that they are on the right track. Green characters indicate that the user has typed the correct character, while red characters indicate that the user has typed an incorrect character. This allows users to quickly identify and correct mistakes. 
 - **Ghost Text as a Cue**: The application uses ghost text to provide users with a cue for the next characters they need to type when they are struggling (stall for more than some time). This helps users focus on continuing in place rather than pulling up the passage again.

## Technology Stack

MemoryWhole is built using:
- React.js for the user interface
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases include:
- User accounts to track progress over time
- Customizable difficulty levels
- User-submitted passages
- Memory games and additional exercises
- Performance analytics and insights
- Mobile app versions
