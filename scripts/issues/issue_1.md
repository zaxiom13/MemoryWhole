# Implement user accounts to track progress over time


## Description
Add user account functionality to allow users to create profiles and track their memorization progress over time.

## Background
Currently, MemoryWhole does not have persistent user profiles. Adding user accounts will enable users to:
- Save their progress across sessions
- Track improvement over time
- Compare their performance with previous attempts
- Access their history of memorized passages

## Requirements
- User registration and login system
- Secure authentication
- Profile management
- Progress tracking and history
- Session persistence across devices


## Implementation Suggestions
- Consider using Firebase Authentication for a quick implementation
- Store user progress data in a database (Firebase Firestore or similar)
- Add a user profile page showing statistics and history
- Implement secure password handling and account recovery options
