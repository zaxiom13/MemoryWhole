# Enable user-submitted passages for memorization


## Description
Allow users to submit their own passages for memorization, expanding the content available beyond the pre-defined passages.

## Background
Currently, MemoryWhole offers a selection of pre-defined passages. Allowing users to submit their own would:
- Significantly expand the content library
- Personalize the learning experience
- Allow users to practice with content relevant to their interests or studies
- Create a community-driven aspect to the application

## Requirements
- Interface for users to submit passages
- Content moderation system or guidelines
- Categorization for user-submitted content
- Option to share passages with other users
- Personal library of user-submitted passages


## Implementation Suggestions
- Create a "Submit Passage" form with title, text, and category fields
- Implement content validation to ensure quality (length limits, content guidelines)
- Add a "My Passages" section in the user profile
- Consider implementing a community rating system for shared passages
- Add search and filter capabilities for the expanded content library
