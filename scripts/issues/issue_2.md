# Add customizable difficulty levels for memory challenges


## Description
Implement adjustable difficulty levels for the memory challenges to accommodate users of different skill levels.

## Background
The current application has a fixed difficulty for memory challenges. Adding customizable difficulty levels will:
- Make the app more accessible to beginners
- Provide appropriate challenges for advanced users
- Create a better progression path for users as they improve

## Requirements
- Multiple predefined difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, etc.)
- Custom difficulty settings (time limits, hints allowed, etc.)
- Difficulty-appropriate scoring
- Visual indication of the current difficulty level


## Implementation Suggestions
- Add difficulty selection in the UI before starting a challenge
- Implement different hint frequencies based on difficulty
- Adjust scoring based on difficulty level
- Consider adding time constraints for higher difficulties
- Add difficulty badges or achievements
