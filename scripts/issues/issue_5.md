# Add performance analytics and insights for users


## Description
Implement detailed performance analytics and personalized insights to help users understand their progress and improve their memorization skills.

## Background
The app currently provides basic completion time feedback. Expanding this with detailed analytics would:
- Help users identify their strengths and weaknesses
- Provide personalized recommendations for improvement
- Make progress more visible and motivating
- Enable data-driven learning strategies

## Requirements
- Detailed metrics (accuracy, speed, retention over time, etc.)
- Visual representation of progress (graphs, charts)
- Performance trends over time
- Personalized insights and recommendations
- Comparison with previous attempts


## Implementation Suggestions
- Create a dashboard showing key metrics
- Implement data visualization using a library like Chart.js or D3.js
- Track metrics like typing speed, error rate, completion time
- Use algorithms to generate personalized insights based on performance patterns
- Add exportable reports for users who want to track progress externally
